Intro
---------------------
Molecule is a free open source peer-to-peer cryptographic currency system that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.

Molecule features a hashing algorithm that favors CPU mining, providing a broader opportunity for regular folks to participate and mine molecules.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Molecule-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`
